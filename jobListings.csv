INCLUSION AT NAV:
At Nav, we celebrate what makes our employees unique because the businesses we serve are progressively diverse and distinctly original. Navericks are diverse, side hustlers, immigrants, veterans, queer, and we push generational boundaries. We are college dropouts, PhDs, special needs parents, allies, pet owners and community leaders. Navericks are human. We are committed to upholding a safe, supportive environment where everyone matters. We are committed to making a better future for all of us. We have created a workplace where people of all backgrounds can express their identities authentically. To put it simply we want you to be proud to be you.

OUR COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY IS SIMPLE BUT POWERFUL.
We believe great, enduring relationships are grounded in trust and transparency. Compensation shouldn’t be a distraction, and employees should understand how pay and career advancement decisions are made. Providing equal pay for equal work is table stakes for being a great place to work. Gender and ethnic inequity should only be something that our children read about in history books. We believe providing Navsters with company ownership, competitive pay, and a range of meaningful benefits is the start of creating a culture where people want to give the best they’ve got — not because they’re simply making money, but because they’ve fallen in love with our vision, mission, values, and team.

We practice straight talk and listen generously to each other with empathy. We value different opinions and point of views. We ensure that we connect outside as well as inside to learn from others and inspire each other.
We hold ourselves accountable for delivering results. We choose to not to be a victim of circumstance. We make decisions & take responsibility so that we can act & support each other, rather than adopting defensive, and “finger pointing” behaviors.
As leaders, we motivate & engage our teams to undertake beyond what they originally thought possible, by developing our teams & creating the conditions for people to grow and empower themselves through enabling & coaching.",https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=689d3e5fd5f06b30&fccid=991e752d1e2c27a1&vjs=3,United States,Utah,South Jordan,indeed.com,HK Tech,165000.0,165000.0,165000.0

SRE / DevOps - Europe | Remote,2021-06-01T21:05:25.973161,Remote,"Remote (Europe)
Who we are?
At Lenses.io we are on a mission to democratize streaming data, helping businesses to operate in real-time.
Our technology allows organizations to practice DataOps, a new way of consuming, processing and moving data. Our product makes working with cutting-edge open-source technologies more accessible to users and operationalizes them for enterprises. Our customers, who range from household names like Daimler-Benz and Adidas to cloud-native startups, use Lenses to help run their strategic streaming and software applications: think IoT, fraud-detection AI engines and cutting-edge consumer-facing microservices.
Looking to make a difference?
The Lenses.io SRE team is expanding, and you could be our next, new valuable member!
More often than not, SRE, DevOps, and Ops stand for way too many responsibilities to list on a single page. We are not going to lie, it’s the same for us, and our little shared secret is that we do enjoy our role —and hopefully, the same stands for you because we have a ton of work ahead of us.
There are three roles currently open:
SRE/Platform with solid abilities in SaaS and managed services (senior)
SRE/Platform, preferably with experience in Apache Kafka (mid/senior)
SRE/DevOps (mid/senior)
We also welcome junior applicants who are eager to evolve their careers.
If you are curious, open-minded, hungry, and eager to learn then Lenses.io is the place for you!
Let’s go over the role descriptions. Note that all our SREs take tasks from both tracks —that’s what we call them, platform and devops—, but the respective track is favored when it comes to architectural tasks or challenging problems.
What your day-to-day looks like:
SRE/Platform
You are focused on providing and supporting services for the company, our clients, and users. Obviously, it has to be fast, secure, scalable, and robust though we keep these descriptions for our presentations. In day-to-day life this means building blocks of infrastructure, implementing new functionality, automating, orchestrating, provisioning, keeping things up-to-date, and maintaining.
SRE/Platform with solid abilities in SaaS and managed services
We want to offer Lenses as a managed service. We have an awesome team building our portal and we are looking into the SRE who will lead the Lenses deployment architecture and implementation. The work has already started but you will play a key role in shaping the Lenses cloud. Our software connects to customers’ systems, has access to data and secrets. It will be your responsibility to make it secure. Words like SoC2 and ISO 270001 should not scare you.
SRE/DevOps
You will be supporting our product directly. Although devops is a culture, DevOps engineers are valuable members who accelerate developers by taking charge of the tough challenges for the delivery process like CICD, release automation and packaging. Mind you that these challenges are not only tough, but they are ongoing. As the product evolves, so does the delivery process.
Primary Technology Stack
The most common parts of our current stack include:
Docker
Kubernetes
Terraform
Jenkins
Google Cloud
Amazon AWS
Bash scripts
Go language
Linux servers
Apache Kafka
Helm
Of course, we touch way more technologies than just these. Our product is developed primarily using the technologies below, so part of your DevOps tasks will include interacting with them:
Scala (JVM), sbt
Javascript (React, Angular), yarn
What you will bring
Hopefully, we are going to spend many years working together. It’s important that we are compatible:
You love being an SRE and are eager to learn and become better
You have some experience in computer science (or similar) and distributed systems
You are not afraid to ask questions, give and receive feedback
You have experience in most of our primary technology stack
You have strong problem-solving skills, which for us means not only you can solve a problem but also you can explain how you did it and why your solution is correct
You are security, performance, and best-practice conscious
You are able to take responsibilities and own projects (implementation or even design-wise)
You like working in a team and you are able to push through language and cultural barriers to work with engineers all over the world
You want to automate everything
No task is beneath or above you. Documentation, support, and even little tasks are things we all do often. This applies even to our CEO!
Passionate about
Technology
Customer Success
Trying new tactics and messaging
Being part of a team
Sharing success with others
Inspiring people
Being Part of the Lenses.io team
You will join our International team with Lensiors spanning 8 countries and Offices in London, Athens, and New York. We have a distributed and remote-friendly culture to cover the full spectrum of working from a modern office to fully remote. (We are currently operating in full remote mode)
You will be defining, not following, the market
You will have a huge individual influence on the direction of the company
An opportunity to work with exceptional people at the forefront of their fields
Even More Benefits
An awesome, open, and vibrant start-up environment
Play a significant role in the development of the company and attain the opportunity for rapid career progression and personal growth
Flexible working hours
An opportunity to work with exceptional, professional people at the forefront of their fields
Be you!
Lenses.io is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace. We celebrate difference, support it, and thrive on a diverse team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, beliefs and experiences. The more inclusive we are, the better we are, and our work will be.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is proud to be the pioneer and widely recognized leader in Cloud Computing. Our web services provide IT infrastructure in-the-cloud that is used by hundreds of thousands of developers and businesses around the world. These customers range from start-ups to leading web companies to Global 500 companies in industries such as financial services, pharmaceuticals, and high technology.

AWS and SAP have been collaborating since SAP became a customer in 2008. Together, we have certified AWS to support most SAP solutions, brought purpose built EC2 instances to market to support SAP customer needs, and helped SAP leverage AWS services to power a number of their SaaS and PaaS offerings like Concur, SuccessFactors (for government agencies), HANA Enterprise Cloud (HEC), and SCP. AWS has been supporting SAP workloads for customers longer than any other cloud provider (since 2011), has more customers (5,000+ across all segments) than any other cloud provider, is certified to support the largest public cloud (native) SAP S/4HANA (48TB) and BW/4HANA (100TB) deployments, and has more SAP HANA cloud native certifications than other cloud providers (24 HANA certifications vs. 18 for Azure and 11 for GCP).

The SAP on AWS team engages SAP customers through 3 routes to market (RTM): the AWS field, consulting partners, and SAP. We are seeking an accomplished leader to build out a high performing GTM team aligned to our global verticals and strategic accounts. The leader will own the overall performance measured by revenue growth, net new customers, and reference wins. The successful candidate will have overachieved throughout their career and built strong, deep relationships with F1000 and/or G2000 organizations.

The right candidate must possess top of the line leadership skills with the ability to execute on key business initiatives.

You will build high-performing teams of solution architects.

You will focus on scaling SAP on AWS, scaling existing AWS services, delivering workload/solution specific domain expertise to the broader field organization, and developing repeatable, packaged solutions to solve customer challenges. As the voice of the customer, your findings will influence product teams to help them evolve the products and address issues, concerns, and requests from the field. To be successful, you will need to analyze and determine key customer insights from business drivers, market trends and customer feedback, and operating metrics.

You will be responsible for establishing clear goals for your team including POCs, speaking engagements, collateral, and more. You must ensure that your team is continuously learning and differentiating AWS with and for customers. You will be expected to plan and allocate for the best use of team resources in order to meet your team goals.

Are you prepared and excited to help build out our data capabilities in Qualtrics?
Interested in a part-time (10-30 hours a week), flexible, remote role?
Do you bring a strong background in survey data principles, such as:
Working with raw survey data to produce clean data sets for analysis and reporting
Conducting statistical tests (such as correlation, regression, ANOVA) to analyze data
Validating quantitative instruments
Determining the appropriate tests/analysis to answer a given research question and then executing that plan
Finding creative ways to visualize and present that data so that it can be useful to guide key strategic decisions?
Don’t feel like you need to be a total expert in those principles - we’re looking to bring on someone who has a great foundation and wants to grow in data analytics and data science. It’s more important that you’re candid and clear about what you need to learn, grow, and thrive - we’re all here to figure out new ways to do that together.
Please do apply even if you only feel you meet part of those qualifications.

100% Remote—WFA (Work From Anywhere)
Flexible hours—work whenever you want
Friendly and supportive globally distributed team—no matter what time it is, someone somewhere in the world is online to say hello and answer questions =)
The Company
Index is a virtual business development assistant that integrates human intelligence (that's you and your team!) and artificial intelligence directly into the customer relationship management (CRM) software used by law firms. Firms use us to ensure that the data in their CRM stays accurate and up to date.
Our team is fully distributed with colleagues across the United States, Germany, France, Romania, the Philippines, and a few full-time world-wanderers who land in a different time zone every few weeks.
We recently announced a partnership with LexisNexis, the leading global provider of computer- assisted legal research (CLAR) and we have law firms lining up to give us tens of thousands of customer contacts to clean.
We're committed to building a company culture that values flexibility, bilateral feedback, and continuous improvement at every level.
You can check out the company website here: https://index.io/
The Position
We’re looking for Data Quality Analysts to perform QA (Quality Assurance) on the work done by our team of Virtual Data Stewards, whose job is to research the customer contacts in our client firms' CRMs. We equip the Data Stewards with the tools to find each contact's LinkedIn or other professional profile as well as their email address, and you'll check to make sure each contact's details are complete, correct, and up-to-date. You'll also give written feedback to help each Data Steward improve.
The starting pay rate is up to $17.50 USD per hour, depending on your region and experience
100% remote working environment with flexible scheduling (you decide when you work and how many hours you work)
There will be opportunities for advancement into team leadership and/or onboarding leadership roles based on your personal preferences and your metrics (speed and data quality)
Requirements
English language proficiency—currently all of our customers are located in the United Kingdom and the USA.
Native-level understanding of the North American/European business landscape—you'll have to make practical judgements about whether the profiles found by the Data Stewards match the contacts in our customers' databases, sometimes based heavily on context (e.g. this particular customer knows a lot of people in the fintech industry and the contact works at Plaid, which you are able to identify as a fintech company, so you can make an educated guess that we've found the correct Bob Smith).
Radical candor—we're looking for leaders who have real compassion for each member of their teams and who welcome the challenges of receiving and giving frank feedback.
Attention to detail—our clients buy our product to ensure that their data is accurate, so we need folks with a laser eye for catching and eliminating typos.
Good time management skills—you'll be working completely remotely! This means you can work from your backyard, the local pub, or a beach in Jamaica, but it also means you'll need to be able to manage your own time really well.
Responsiveness—we're a young, growing company and things change a lot! You'll need to be vigilant about keeping up with instant messages, emails, and changes to the documentation for all types of tasks that you work on.
Resourcefulness—if your direct manager is offline, you'll need to be able to look up the answers to your questions in our online wiki, work through them with a teammate, or find a workaround until leadership can get back to you.
Kindness—we're a global community with teammates from all kinds of different places and backgrounds, and we think it's important to approach our differences with compassion and curiosity.
Responsibilities
Meticulously check the Data Stewards' research on the professional contacts in our client firms' CRMs to verify each contact's details (Company Name, Job Title, Location, Email Address, and LinkedIn or other professional profile).
Process contacts marked ""Could Not Complete"" by Data Stewards, as well as conflict resolution tasks where two Data Stewards entered two different solutions
Maintain an average speed of ≤2 minutes/contact QAed and ≤3 minutes/task marked ""Could Not Complete"" with an average accuracy score of ≥ 90% across both task types. (Don't worry—we know it will take a couple of weeks for you to get this fast!)
Be responsive to communication from your team (this includes keeping up to date with work emails, announcements made in Slack channels relevant to your job, direct Slack messages from management, and ongoing changes to task guides for any tasks you work on)
Attend a 30-minute 1:1 meeting with your direct manager every other week.
Submit an invoice for your hours worked by the 8th of each month.
How to Apply
All you need to do is email a cover letter to layne(at)index(dot)io and attach your resume. In your email, please include your answers to the following three questions:
Why are you interested in being a Data Quality Analyst at Index?
Have you ever worked remotely? If so, what did you do and how did it go for you?
What do you like to do in your free time?
We'll let you know within two weeks whether we would like to move forward. If so, you'll receive a trial QA task to do in a Google spreadsheet. It usually takes 60-90 minutes and we'll pay you for the time if you're hired. After the trial task, a team member will reach out to let you know whether or not we'd like to schedule a 30-minute interview. And after the interview, we'll make a decision. We're looking forward to getting to know you! =)

Data Quality Analyst (Fully Remote),2021-06-19T21:06:36,Remote,"Data Quality Analyst
100% Remote—WFA (Work From Anywhere)
Flexible hours—work whenever you want
Friendly and supportive globally distributed team—no matter what time it is, someone somewhere in the world is online to say hello and answer questions =)
The Company
Index is a virtual business development assistant that integrates human intelligence (that's you and your team!) and artificial intelligence directly into the customer relationship management (CRM) software used by law firms. Firms use us to ensure that the data in their CRM stays accurate and up to date.
Our team is fully distributed with colleagues across the United States, Germany, France, Romania, the Philippines, and a few full-time world-wanderers who land in a different time zone every few weeks.
We recently announced a partnership with LexisNexis, the leading global provider of computer- assisted legal research (CLAR) and we have law firms lining up to give us tens of thousands of customer contacts to clean.
We're committed to building a company culture that values flexibility, bilateral feedback, and continuous improvement at every level.
You can check out the company website here: https://index.io/
The Position
We’re looking for Data Quality Analysts to perform QA (Quality Assurance) on the work done by our team of Virtual Data Stewards, whose job is to research the customer contacts in our client firms' CRMs. We equip the Data Stewards with the tools to find each contact's LinkedIn or other professional profile as well as their email address, and you'll check to make sure each contact's details are complete, correct, and up-to-date. You'll also give written feedback to help each Data Steward improve.
The starting pay rate is up to $17.50 USD per hour, depending on your region and experience
100% remote working environment with flexible scheduling (you decide when you work and how many hours you work)
There will be opportunities for advancement into team leadership and/or onboarding leadership roles based on your personal preferences and your metrics (speed and data quality)
Requirements
English language proficiency—currently all of our customers are located in the United Kingdom and the USA.
Native-level understanding of the North American/European business landscape—you'll have to make practical judgements about whether the profiles found by the Data Stewards match the contacts in our customers' databases, sometimes based heavily on context (e.g. this particular customer knows a lot of people in the fintech industry and the contact works at Plaid, which you are able to identify as a fintech company, so you can make an educated guess that we've found the correct Bob Smith).
Radical candor—we're looking for leaders who have real compassion for each member of their teams and who welcome the challenges of receiving and giving frank feedback.
Attention to detail—our clients buy our product to ensure that their data is accurate, so we need folks with a laser eye for catching and eliminating typos.
Good time management skills—you'll be working completely remotely! This means you can work from your backyard, the local pub, or a beach in Jamaica, but it also means you'll need to be able to manage your own time really well.
Responsiveness—we're a young, growing company and things change a lot! You'll need to be vigilant about keeping up with instant messages, emails, and changes to the documentation for all types of tasks that you work on.
Resourcefulness—if your direct manager is offline, you'll need to be able to look up the answers to your questions in our online wiki, work through them with a teammate, or find a workaround until leadership can get back to you.
Kindness—we're a global community with teammates from all kinds of different places and backgrounds, and we think it's important to approach our differences with compassion and curiosity.
Responsibilities
Meticulously check the Data Stewards' research on the professional contacts in our client firms' CRMs to verify each contact's details (Company Name, Job Title, Location, Email Address, and LinkedIn or other professional profile).
Process contacts marked ""Could Not Complete"" by Data Stewards, as well as conflict resolution tasks where two Data Stewards entered two different solutions
Maintain an average speed of ≤2 minutes/contact QAed and ≤3 minutes/task marked ""Could Not Complete"" with an average accuracy score of ≥ 90% across both task types. (Don't worry—we know it will take a couple of weeks for you to get this fast!)
Be responsive to communication from your team (this includes keeping up to date with work emails, announcements made in Slack channels relevant to your job, direct Slack messages from management, and ongoing changes to task guides for any tasks you work on)
Attend a 30-minute 1:1 meeting with your direct manager every other week.
Submit an invoice for your hours worked by the 8th of each month.
How to Apply
All you need to do is email a cover letter to layne(at)index(dot)io and attach your resume. In your email, please include your answers to the following three questions:
Why are you interested in being a Data Quality Analyst at Index?
Have you ever worked remotely? If so, what did you do and how did it go for you?
What do you like to do in your free time?
We'll let you know within two weeks whether we would like to move forward. If so, you'll receive a trial QA task to do in a Google spreadsheet. It usually takes 60-90 minutes and we'll pay you for the time if you're hired. After the trial task, a team member will reach out to let you know whether or not we'd like to schedule a 30-minute interview. And after the interview, we'll make a decision. We're looking forward to getting to know you! =)

Data Scientist,2021-05-25T21:06:56.525690,Texas,"The CognitOps Story

CognitOps is a cloud and ML-driven supply chain startup founded in 2018 and headquartered in Austin, TX. Our purpose is to improve supply chains through better operations management. We're building the brain for every warehouse in the world (and eventually on Mars) to help leaders make faster and better decisions, and we hope you can join us!

CognitOps was founded by a team of lifelong supply chain technology builders. We realized that today's supply chains are unsustainable and wasteful for businesses, jobs, and the environment. And with the support of our family, friends, pets, and investors, we chose to take this challenge head-on bravely. Backed by some of the best VCs in the industry, we began our pursuit of unleashing ingenuity to give rise to resilient businesses.

Why CognitOps?

We tackle cool, challenging problems. For example, we help warehouses supply hospitals with PPE and critical medical equipment more efficiently. We help e-commerce businesses ship orders on time. We tackle these challenging problems using modern technologies like machine learning, queue-based simulation, Google Cloud, Kubernetes, Kafka, and Scala. Our team has decades of startup experience working with big data and building scalable, fault-tolerant, secure software and decades of experience working with warehouses and empathetically understanding the needs they have. We're still a small early-stage company. So you'll have an opportunity to come in, make a huge impact, and be a leader as the company grows. But at the same time, we have significant early customer traction and are already on an accelerated growth path. We believe in having a fun, loose work environment while also fostering a culture grounded in grit, accountability, innovation, collaboration, and bravery.

The Challenge

Supply chains are struggling to evolve. For every 1 billion dollars of e-commerce growth, North America builds 1 million more square feet of warehousing. Yet, warehouses are fraught with waste. Why? Because operations managers and leaders have never had the tools to manage their facilities correctly. It's mind-boggling to think that the industry continues to invest in robots and point solutions that only perpetuate this broken model. This challenge is compounded by people understandably not wanting to work in these environments. We can fix this together. We can build in the cloud, apply machine learning, build unique products and datasets, and be nonconformists always challenging the status quo together.

What You Bring

Experience in successfully…

Using data, mathematics, machine learning, statistics, and coding to solve real-word business problems that create real value for stakeholders;
Collaborating with technical and non-technical professionals to define and deliver high-quality solutions, quickly;
Bring analytics and machine learning models to production;
Writing clean, maintainable code and doing truly reproducible research;
Developing deep empathy for users and customers;
Excellent capacity to communicate about complex technical issues with broad and diverse audiences --- both technical and not; and,
Constantly learning new approaches, methods and tools. You show the exuberant curiosity of a lifelong student.

The following creds get us interested…

A demonstrated history of delivering solutions and prioritizing getting things done over getting things perfect
Expertise with the standard Python scientific stack: numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn
Knowledge of modeling best practices
You don't think a data scientist's job stops when the model converges -- you want to see project through to the end and aren't satisfied until users see real value
You know when linear regression is the right choice, and when to reach for something more complicated

The following creds get us excited…

Experience with observational causal modeling, deploying deep learning models, online model training, or user-facing model interpretability
An ability to contribute to ETL pipelines at scale; we use Spark, Scala, Kafka and other modern tools to move our data around
Knowledge of MLOps practices and technologies for deploying machine learning in a SaaS environment; we use MlFlow, Airflow, Docker and other tools to manage a continuous training and delivery pipeline for our models
You care about what you do
You care about what we do
You live our values

We want to see your problem-solving and analytical skills. Be prepared to write good, clean code. You don't need to know our entire stack, but we're looking for practical experience. We want to see that you can deliver practical solutions to meaningful research problems. Our hiring process is swift:

Recruiter Phone Screen
Hiring Manager Screening
Team Interview
Values Interview w/Co-Founders

Life at CognitOps

At CognitOps, being an Equal Opportunity Employer means more than upholding discrimination-free hiring practices. It means that we cultivate an environment where people can be their most authentic selves and find both belonging and support. We're on a mission to change supply chains -- an experience made whole by our unique backgrounds and perspectives.

We encourage our employees to care for their whole selves with reimbursed and hassle-free health benefits through our HRA, truly unlimited paid time off, paid parental leave, safe company social events, and freedom to pursue volunteer opportunities.",https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=70c3923e7850f4d4&fccid=8e93b82c0003440f&vjs=3,United States,,,indeed.com,CognitOps,,,

The mission of the Allen Institute is to unlock the complexities of bioscience and advance our knowledge to improve human health. Using an open science, multi-scale, team-oriented approach, the Allen Institute focuses on accelerating foundational research, developing standards and models, and cultivating new ideas to make a broad, transformational impact on science.
The MindScope program seeks to understand the transformations, sometimes called computations, in coding and decoding that lead from photons to behavior and conscious experience by observing, perturbing and modeling the physical transformations of signals in the cortical-thalamic visual system within a few perception-action cycles.
We are seeking a Scientist to be an essential member of a team investigating cell-type-specific function in the context of learning and behavior. This Scientist will contribute to a cutting-edge new project at the Allen Institute, integrating in vivo neurophysiology during behavior (https://portal.brain-map.org/explore/circuits/visual-behavior-2p) with transcriptomics (https://portal.brain-map.org/explore/transcriptome).
This project bridges two pillars of neuroscience – systems-level investigation of circuit function and dynamics in behaving animals, and molecular genetic analysis of neuronal cell types. To accomplish this, we are combining in vivo 2-photon imaging (Sofroniew et al., 2016; Orlova et al., 2020) in mice learning a behavioral task (Garrett et al., 2020; Groblewski et al., 2020) with post-hoc spatial transcriptomics (Tasic et al., 2018; Economo et al., 2018) to map cell types to functional properties during task learning. The datasets and tools created as part of this project will be publicly released as an open resource for the community, in line with the Allen Institute’s core principles of big science, open science, and team science.
The primary role of this Scientist will be to perform computational analysis of multi-modal datasets to make novel discoveries about the function of cell types, with a focus on analysis and interpretation of transcriptomic data. Accordingly, aptitude for machine learning methods including supervised and unsupervised clustering, dimensionality reduction, classification, and statistics are essential to this role. Demonstrated ability to produce dynamic and informative visualizations using multi-modal data is also highly valued. Prior experience working with transcriptomic datasets is ideal.
This Scientist will work closely with other Scientists, Engineers, and Technicians to guide experimental design based on initial results and scientific goals, and to contribute to the development of standardized, open source workflows for data processing and analysis (including the AllenSDK and starfish). As part of a highly collaborative team environment, good communication and enthusiasm for working with, learning from, and teaching others is essential to this role.
The Allen Institute believes that team science significantly benefits from the participation of diverse voices, experiences, and backgrounds. High-quality science can only be produced when it includes different perspectives. We are committed to increasing diversity across every team and encourage people from all backgrounds to apply for this role.

Security Clearance

This position does not currently require a Department of Energy (DOE) security clearance.
Sandia will conduct a pre-employment drug test and background review that includes checks of personal references, credit, law enforcement records, and employment/education verifications. Furthermore, employees in New Mexico need to pass a U.S. Air Force background screen for access to Kirtland Air Force Base. Substance abuse or illegal drug use, falsification of information, criminal activity, serious misconduct or other indicators of untrustworthiness can cause access to be denied or terminated, resulting in the inability to perform the duties assigned and subsequent termination of employment.
If hired without a clearance and it subsequently becomes necessary to obtain and maintain one for the position, or you bid on positions that require a clearance, a pre-processing background review may be conducted prior to a required federal background investigation. Applicants for a DOE security clearance need to be U.S. citizens. If you hold more than one citizenship (i.e., of the U.S. and another country), your ability to obtain a security clearance may be impacted.
Members of the workforce (MOWs) hired at Sandia who require uncleared access for greater than 179 days during their employment, are required to go through the Uncleared Personal Identity Verification (UPIV) process. Access includes physical and/or cyber (logical) access, as well as remote access to any NNSA information technology (IT) systems. UPIV requirements are not applicable to individuals who require a DOE personnel security clearance for the performance of their SNL employment or to foreign nationals. The UPIV process will include the completion of a USAccess Enrollment, SF-85 (Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions) and OF-306 (Declaration of for Federal Employment). An unfavorable UPIV determination will result in immediate retrieval of the SNL issued badge, removal of cyber (logical) access and/or removal from SNL subcontract. All MOWs may appeal the unfavorable UPIV determination to DOE/NNSA immediately. If the appeal is unsuccessful, the MOW may try to go through the UPIV process one year after the decision date.

Researcher 7 - Pryke BICEP-Array Winter Over,2021-05-25T21:08:08.384882,"Minneapolis, MN 55455 (University District area)","Required
This Research positions require a M.S. degree in Physics, Astronomy or Engineering with substantial research and publication record. Knowledge and experience with mechanical, electronic and computer systems is required. Field experience and the proven ability to diagnose and repair complicated scientific instruments in the field are required.

Mental Demands: Problem-solving, multi-tasking, organizing, instrument reading, detailed work, reasoning, interpersonal skills, oral communication, written communication. Work independently and efficiently while isolated. The capability to make correct and level headed decisions under pressure in the field. Due to the remote and challenging nature of the job site, the position requires an exceptionally mentally-stable individual who is self-motivated, but also able to communicate and take direction well.

Physical Demands: The Researcher must be able to work in a harsh environment. Working with hands, bending, stooping, climbing on telescopes, and moderate to heavy lifting. Again due to the job site, good physical health is also required.

Preferred:
Experience and knowledge of cryogenic and telescope control systems.

Researcher 7 (working title: Research Fellow):

The BICEP-Array winter over Researcher is solely responsible for the success or failure of the entire experiment once the Austral summer team leaves. The experiment represents an investment of approximately $20 million and 40-person years of effort by a team of more than 20 people. Poor judgment or decision making could result in the experiment being crippled for the remainder of the winter season resulting in huge implied costs and loss of scientific competitiveness. We plan carefully for every eventuality and keep many spare parts on site. Nevertheless, the possibility for unrecoverable failure due to human error exists and has occurred in the past.

The researcher will start work in September or October 2021 and deploy to South Pole via New Zealand in late October or early November. They will remain at South Pole until November 2022 through the long Antarctic night. During this period, they will have sole responsibility for maintaining and operating the telescope while science data is recorded.

During the winter the Researcher will receive considerable support and guidance via internet and satellite telephone communications. Nevertheless, the position requires an exceptionally stable individual who is self-motivated, but also able to communicate and take direction well. It is critical that the work be conducted competently. Decisions, judgments and recommendations made by the Researcher will have a major impact on the success of the project.

Job Description
The School of Physics and Astronomy is looking for a full time Researcher to work on a cosmic microwave background polarization experiment located at the South Pole. A winter-over Researcher is required to maintain and operate the BICEP-Array experiment at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. BICEP-Array is a new telescope system poised to make ground-breaking measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation left over from the big bang birth of the Universe. The South Pole Station has a summer population of around 150 and a winter population of around 40. During the winter season (northern hemisphere's summer) travel to/from the base is not possible for eight months due to the extreme cold.

30% Instrument integration, calibration and commissioning and calibration.
During the Austral summer season assist a team of specialists with the installation of complex new microwave receivers into the existing telescope mount and control systems.

65% Maintain and operate the telescope while science data is recorded.
During the Austral winter season this will involve routine monitoring of the compressed helium refrigerator system and monitoring of the accumulating data to detect problems with the instrument in a proactive manner. As and when problems arise with any of the telescope sub-systems the winter-over Researcher must then work to diagnose and rectify them, often seeking assistance from remote team members. Make sure the systems are working properly. Design and modify parts for the best performance of the telescope. The winter-over will collaborate in the observation design to maximize experimental efficiency. The winter-over scientist is responsible for daily monitoring of the data quality. Detection of sometimes subtle problems is critical to avoid wastage of time and make the most efficient use possible of the very large investment of money and manpower which the telescope represents. The winter-over scientist is invited to collaborate in the higher level interpretation of the data in so far as on-site computing power and fulfillment of their other critical day-to-day duties allows.

Diagnose, Problem Solve and Repair
The telescope is a complex system with optical, electronic, cryogenic, mechanical and software components, so skills in all parts are necessary. The Researcher will diagnose and correct errors to make sure the telescope is working properly, The South Pole is a very harsh place not just for people, but also for the equipment where the experience from previous seasons helps for dealing with certain facts, i.e. high altitude, low humidity, high static. Improvising is very important since there is a very limited supply of spare parts. The Researcher must be able to decide about repairs to keep the telescope running around the clock. Receiving feedback from the U.S. may take many hours or days due to the different time zones internet availability.

Independent Decisions
The Researcher will be the only person manning the telescope during winter. The lab is isolated and only has internet for a few hours per day. There are a lot of situations which demand an independent decision. The telescope runs around the clock. Major decisions we try to make in the collaboration, but there are certain emergencies like power outages, ice plugs, shorts etc. that might need a decision without the time to ask the collaboration, and, in the worst case, the telescope can be at stake.

5% Regular collaboration with the Principal Investigator (PI) for the project.
Weekly status reports at a minimum to the PI, along with daily interaction with project team members.

The above statements are intended to describe the general nature of the work being performed by people assigned to this job. They do not comprise an exhaustive list of all duties and responsibilities associated with it.

Other duties of a similar scope as assigned.

Apprenticeship Overview
Summary
Apprenticeship includes two phases: RTI (required technical instruction) and OJT (on-the-job training). RTI prepares apprentices to work productively during OJT. On the job, a software analyst is tasked with maintaining, testing, and updating software products under the supervision of experienced developers, engineers and architects. This role provides more flexibility through a shorter and more focused RTI phase to allow for markets or positions with a lower required experience level, or where specialized training will be a major component of OJT
(e.g., embedded systems, cloud services, machine learning), or as a stepping stone to a project or program management career path. Although the apprenticeship will focus on coding, the majority of a software developer’s time is generally not spent writing new applications, especially at the junior level. Instead the focus is on improving existing products and applications by adding features, finding and eliminating bugs, and improving efficiency. Related occupational roles include software developers (a more in-depth version of this role with additional focus on security, distributed systems, and design patterns) and DevOps specialists/network operations developers (who configure the build, test, and deployment environments for developers).
RTI Preparation
Apprentices generally receive instruction in web fundamentals (2 weeks), JavaScript/Python programming (4 weeks), and additional training in Python, C#, or Java software development
(6-8 weeks). This varies by location, training provider availability, and employer requests. A sample training plan follows at the end of this document. We cannot guarantee availability or timing of this exact plan in all markets.
Apprentices in this role will not earn certifications, but instead will be evaluated based on the quality of their code submissions or general productivity, as established by the employer.
OJT Activities
Software analysts generally work on tasks substantially similar to the following during OJT. The exact weight and distribution of these tasks varies by employer and may change over the course of OJT as the apprentice becomes more proficient with advanced tasks.
Project Definition o Identify and capture stakeholder requirements using customer interviews and surveys. o Build multiple use cases to describe each action that a user will take in the new system. o Understand and contribute to requirement specification documents.
Software Design o Work with stakeholders to understand requirements.
o Specify and scope hardware and system requirements. o Identify and mitigate security threats and vulnerabilities that may arise from interactions with other systems, external and legacy code.
Development and Implementation o Develop and write software code.
o Perform unit testing and fix errors or bugs.
Software Testing o Work with development team to create test plans.
o Implement test cases. o Find and fix bugs.
Deployment and Maintenance o Perform training for end users.
o Evaluate and fix bugs that may become apparent after product deployment.

Does it intrigue you as both a necessary and valuable question for people to answer? If so, we'd love to meet you.

At Datatron, we create technology to help the growing number of companies sprinting towards reliance on machine learning as part of their operations. Our combination of model ops and governance products ensure machine learning artifacts created by our customers are easy for them to deploy, highly available, and continuously measured for target performance...regardless of how they were developed. We help them guard against bias and drift, safely manage the release of new versions, and alert them to potential issues as they arise. We take pride in the unique, agnostic platform we provide and believe we are contributing to the cause of ethical AI; after all, can it fundamentally be ethical if you cannot rely on it?

As a Machine Learning Engineer on our team, you will be developing services which create an integration layer between our platform and our customer's unique machine learning artifacts. Quickly you will assess and recommend the right ways to measure effectiveness and detect anomalies, helping to develop configurable governance analytics for models which are necessary to monitor reliability of performance. You will find means to integrate and interact with different providers of data science tools and ML solutions to extend the options available to customer data scientists, as they enter testing and deployment phases, so that tasks which currently take them weeks and months of effort for each model take hours or days instead, all thanks to you.

We're looking for people who have:
At least 3 to 5 years of full-time coding, preferably with high proficiency in Python
Insight into how the operational realities of data science can be better managed and accelerated
Significant focus in the past on MLOps, building data pipelines, and evaluating libraries

Incorporated local data caches for pre-population of features and stateful model support
Experience with one or more popular machine learning frameworks and workbench products
A willingness to adapt, are passionate about accelerating model lifecycles, and capable of working independently, putting in extra effort when necessary, as we are an early stage startup

Our benefits include:
Medical/dental/vision coverage
401k
Lunch provided daily (and dinner when required!)
Abundant snacks and drinks
Dedicated, heavily discounted parking and Clipper Direct
Gym reimbursement
Weekly happy hours and monthly company outings
$10k referral bonuses, because after we hire you, we'd love to hire some of your friends!

We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity very highly at our company.

Senior Machine Learning Engineer (Remote),2021-05-25T21:08:27.850004,Oregon,"Hello there!

Go’s Data Science team is looking for an exceptional Senior Machine Learning Engineer to join our fully remote team.
About Team Go
Team Go was started with the simple premise that our real-world connections matter, that people matter. We believe in a world where social technology unites us and makes us happier. Our team is on a mission to fix social isolation and bring people together to do the things they love with the people they love.
Go also represents a new paradigm in social technology: no harvesting of user data, a fully transparent revenue model, and a social technology company whose north star is Patagonia, not Palantir.
The Role
As a Senior Machine Learning Engineer on the team, you will have an outsized impact on our applied machine learning research and production systems. You’ll work with data scientists, data engineers, and cross-functionally across the org to build prototype models, iterate upon them, launch them, and monitor their performance in production.
For this role, we’re looking for a generalist with a natural language processing background. You will primarily work on our text categorization and scoring models using tools like SpaCy, Spark NLP, Textacy, Gensim, Sci-kit Learn, and Tensorflow.
In this role, you’ll work with a modern data stack and a serverless streaming data architecture. Our stack can be described as a collection of microservices using tools such as AWS Lambda, Kinesis Firehose, AWS S3, AWS Glue, Amazon Athena, API Gateway, SageMaker, Mode Analytics, and Spark [Databricks].
About You
You have a BS or higher in Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Economics or other quantitative field
You have at least two years of experience working on applied machine learning systems in production cloud environments (AWS, Google Cloud, etc)
You have experience along the entire machine learning product lifecycle, from initial data ingest and data prep, through to modeling and creating REST API endpoints or managing batch inference workloads, and subsequently monitoring model performance and evaluating drift.
You’re technically competent with the Python data science ecosystem (Pandas, Numpy, SciPy, Sci-kit, Jupyter); Apache Spark, and associated frameworks (Spark NLP, Spark Streaming, Spark MLlib); and Tensorflow/Keras.
You have production experience with messy natural language systems. You know all about tokenization, feature vectorization, word embedding, and training transformer-based language models. You’ve seen algorithms fail due to bad input data.
You are a skilled written communicator. Our team is 100% remote and writing is our primary means of communication. You communicate complex technical topics clearly and in an approachable way.

Machine Learning Engineer,2021-05-25T14:54:07,Remote,"Company Description
Musculoskeletal (MSK) problems are the costliest medical category today, accounting for $432 billion cost alone in the US, four times the cost of diabetes and Heart disease. One key reason for this high cost has been the current “fee-for service” care model in the US where patients are treated in an uncoordinated manner throughout their care pathway. The mission of SpineZone is to reduce both the unnecessary suffering of these MSK patients and the total cost of care through an integrated holistic program that includes not only physical therapy but also education, diet and behavioral programs. The company was started by a group of spinal surgeons whose philosophy is to acknowledge the latent potentials of both mind and the body to heal and correct itself, and only intervening with costly injections and surgery when all other non-invasive interventions have not alleviated the suffering. The company has been operating several physical therapy clinics in California as well as an online, and has accumulated a trove of structured and unstructured data covering several years of patient features, interventions and outcomes. The company is also contributing to medical research through publications in leading journals and conferences in MSK.
We are now looking to expand the ML team whose mission is to develop, implement and deploy models and contribute to the ongoing scientific research efforts.
Job Description
You will be an early member of the ML team, with a unique opportunity to work on high dimensional data in the MSK domain. No other institution knows as many features about a MSK patient than SpineZone. You can shape and lead directions of the team and work closely with various teams, including:
Clinical team (spine surgeons, physical therapists, spine research professors): to understand nuances of the data and the domain, define new clinical questions and research directions as well as validate model development and predictions.
Product team: to understand customer (therapists, insurance clients, PCPs, ..) needs and opportunities
ML team: to support complementary efforts and help refine the end-to-end MLOps architecture and technologies, from labeling platforms, high dimensional ETLs to model serving and distribution shift detection and retraining pipelines.
Requirements
We are looking for applied ML researchers in mid to senior stages of their career to join us in this exciting journey to reduce the unnecessary suffering of patients. The position can be remote or in San Diego, CA. In particular, we are looking for individuals who have the following characteristics:
Technical
Have at least a masters or preferably a doctoral degree in AI/ML, biostatistics, epidemiology, with publications in respectable venues (e.g. NeurIPs, ICML, ICRL, CVPR, ACL, etc.)
Has an understanding of basic statistical methodology and experimental design principles.
Has deep experience in at least one of:
CV
NLP
RL
Causal modeling (contextual bandits, batch off-policy evaluation, sequential decision making, TMLE, etc.)
Excellent data and programming skills including:
languages: python3, Julia, C++
Database: postgres, sql
Big Data: Spark, Big Table, Athena
Cloud: AWS / GCP
Versioning: git
ML: Pytorch / TF, Pandas/Dask, Scikit-learn,
MLOps (optional): Sagemaker, MLFlow
Soft Skills
Can interact with non-ML experts (clinical researchers, therapists, surgeons, etc.) and explain complex concepts in a clear and concise manner.
Prefers to work in a collaborative rather than isolated mode
Evidence based approach for modeling and evaluation. Be able to nimbly adjust to study findings and change direction.
(optional) Able to grow the team.

Butter is building the payments stack for the modern subscription economy. We're creating an inclusive remote-first culture that enables our employees to contribute from anywhere in the world. Come join our team to help modernize subscription payments!

TLDR:
You're our data handler. You make sure our data shows up on time, arrives in good condition and leaves the party when appropriate.

Problem TLDR:
Dirty data gets in the way of reporting, machine learning models and our general sanity.

Problem Expanded:
We ingest 3rd-party data from multiple payment providers, such as Stripe, clean it and normalize it for our schema and machine learning pipelines. We're seeking to build transformation and validation layers as far upstream as possible to ensure a smooth flow of data through our system. The transformation layer will make the data easier to work with for our reporting products and ML models, while the validation layer will ensure the data conforms to our expectations. For example: Is it null, NULL, or 'null'? Is 342 a valid country abbreviation code?

As we expand our product offering and ingest data from additional companies and 3rd-party providers the complexity of the challenge will evolve over time, keeping the problem fresh.

Scope:
You'll get to architect our system and lay the foundation for the future from both a technology and a system design perspective. No longer will data show up without being tested and structured, as you'll create a system that checks its worst tendencies. You'll work closely with our ML and Eng team to ensure the design meets their requirements and that data properly flows through the system.

Areas you're comfortable with:
You'll have 3+ years experience and be familiar with distributed systems and data processing frameworks such as Scala and Spark and workflow orchestration tools like Argo and Airflow. You've worked in a cloud environment such as AWS, GCP or Azure. Yes, other languages/tools are fine as long as you can articulate how you've used the technology to solve similar problems.

Designing a data system from scratch is something that excites you and you're able to clearly articulate the tradeoffs of different approaches. You've likely built some version of this before, validated data, created reports and perhaps dabbled in an ML model or too.

Philosophies:
You strongly believe that action creates information.
You want to work on a small team and have lots of responsibility.
You look forward to being scrappy and enjoy overcoming challenges.
We are focused on building a diverse and inclusive workforce. If you’re excited about this role, but do not meet 100% of the qualifications listed above, we encourage you to apply.

Junior Data Engineer,2021-06-22T21:09:07.695899,New York State,"Organizational Overview

We know movement organizing and advocacy are more urgent than ever and many organizations and activists cannot easily access the tools to scale their work.

Launched in 2018, The Movement Cooperative (TMC) is a nonprofit founded with the aim of creating a cooperative community addressing these structural challenges. Currently, our membership stands at more than 50 national member organizations and 500 state-based organizations covered under our licenses. We leverage the collective purchasing power of our membership to secure cooperatively held data and technology licenses shared across membership and invest in common infrastructure like technical staff to support our members in their work. TMC is a member cooperative -- our board is elected by and made up of our member organizations.

Position Overview

We are seeking a proactive learner who wants to grow their programming skills in practice, while working closely with progressive organizations on a wide range of projects.

Responsibilities:
Daily monitoring of data infrastructure, including TMC-built syncs from vendor tools to TMC's data warehouse (e.g. re-runs, column re-sizes, etc)
Investigate and resolve breakages of TMC-built data syncs
Within first three months, engage the open-source Parsons community
Build new data syncs in Python as requested by TMC members
Work with Engineers to develop new syncs
Act as first user tester for and provide input on new TMC software products
Work with external software vendors when building and troubleshooting TMC data infrastructure

Required skills and competencies:
Robust Python knowledge and abilities
Elemental SQL abilities
Basic git and Github skills
Ability to manage data pipeline infrastructure responsibly and efficiently
Foster communications clearly and succinctly
Ability to explain technical concepts to non-technical audiences
Inclination toward member focused customer service (i.e. technical support tasks)
Ability to work independently and as a team player, to take initiative, and to manage multiple tasks and projects at a time
Exceptional attention to detail, accuracy and consistency

We especially support applications from people who have these additional attributes:

Familiarity with or participation in one or more open source communities
Experience in progressive political organizing, especially with political data
Familiarity with AWS (Redshift and S3, especially)
Experience working within a remote team or organization, or using remote communication software like Slack
Familiarity with Civis Platform

Benefits

While a very young organization, The Movement Cooperative is dedicated to providing all employees a competitive salary, world-class healthcare, dental and vision benefits, retirement, paid vacation and sick days, flexible holidays, and all-staff holidays, remote virtual office, paid parental and adoption family leaves, and health and wellness benefits. The salary for this position is $80,000-$85,000. This is a full-time exempt position. This position is within a union-represented collective bargaining unit, and specific terms and conditions of employment may be subject to a future collective bargaining agreement between TMC and the Union.

The Movement Cooperative is an equal opportunity employer.

The Movement Cooperative recruits, employs, trains, compensates and promotes regardless of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, citizenship status, disability, age, veteran status, and other protected status as required by applicable law.

At The Movement Cooperative, we have a clear vision: to be the organization where a diverse mix of talented people want to be, to stay and do their best work. We pride ourselves on bringing the best to our members, and we know our organization runs on the hard work and dedication of our passionate and creative employees.

At The Movement Cooperative, we have committed to and aspire to center diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout all of our work. We believe that our work fundamentally depends on our ability to create a culture that's equitable and inclusive for people of all races, genders, sexual orientations, religions, ethnicities, locations, national origins, and other characteristics not listed here. We believe that the broader progressive movement and world should also operate in these ways and achieve a world where that is the case is at the core of the mission of our organization and the missions of many of the member organizations we support. Our commitment to these principles are grounded in the idea that we can never achieve those missions if we don't also reflect these values internally. We, at TMC, also recognize that while we list these here as commitments, we also imperfectly embody them in practice. In many ways, we continue to perpetuate the same structures, behaviors, and orientations that stifle full equity, empowerment, inclusivity, and belonging. We acknowledge that perfection is unattainable and anticipate falling short.. However, we are deeply committed, and view with the utmost urgency, the ongoing work, reflection, and intentionality that will move us closer to these aspirations both immediately and in the long term. We actively encourage & invite applicants who share these commitments, are willing to proactively share the responsibility of co-creating an organizational culture that increasingly embodies these values & principles, and are enthusiastic about joining a team where we hold each other mutually accountable to not deviating from these commitments.

Machine Learning Engineer,2021-05-25T21:08:24,California,"Machine Learning Engineer (Remote)

Our world relies on AI more and more each day. But what does it actually mean for AI to be 'reliable'? As you consider the question, are you finding that the rabbit hole grows deeper and deeper? Does it intrigue you as both a necessary and valuable question for people to answer? If so, we'd love to meet you.

At Datatron, we create technology to help the growing number of companies sprinting towards reliance on machine learning as part of their operations. Our combination of model ops and governance products ensure machine learning artifacts created by our customers are easy for them to deploy, highly available, and continuously measured for target performance...regardless of how they were developed. We help them guard against bias and drift, safely manage the release of new versions, and alert them to potential issues as they arise. We take pride in the unique, agnostic platform we provide and believe we are contributing to the cause of ethical AI; after all, can it fundamentally be ethical if you cannot rely on it?

As a Machine Learning Engineer on our team, you will be developing services which create an integration layer between our platform and our customer's unique machine learning artifacts. Quickly you will assess and recommend the right ways to measure effectiveness and detect anomalies, helping to develop configurable governance analytics for models which are necessary to monitor reliability of performance. You will find means to integrate and interact with different providers of data science tools and ML solutions to extend the options available to customer data scientists, as they enter testing and deployment phases, so that tasks which currently take them weeks and months of effort for each model take hours or days instead, all thanks to you.

We're looking for people who have:
At least 3 to 5 years of full-time coding, preferably with high proficiency in Python
Insight into how the operational realities of data science can be better managed and accelerated
Significant focus in the past on MLOps, building data pipelines, and evaluating libraries
Previous projects deeply involving Kubernetes and containerization of models
Developed against AWS and Azure services on occasion and deployed on the same
Incorporated local data caches for pre-population of features and stateful model support
Experience with one or more popular machine learning frameworks and workbench products
A willingness to adapt, are passionate about accelerating model lifecycles, and capable of working independently, putting in extra effort when necessary, as we are an early stage startup

Our benefits include:
Medical/dental/vision coverage
401k
Lunch provided daily (and dinner when required!)
Abundant snacks and drinks
Dedicated, heavily discounted parking and Clipper Direct
Gym reimbursement
Weekly happy hours and monthly company outings
$10k referral bonuses, because after we hire you, we'd love to hire some of your friends!

SecurityTrails strives to make the biggest treasure-trove of cyber intelligence data readily available in an instant. We work relentlessly to empower experts so they can thwart future attacks with up-to-date data, proprietary tools, and custom solutions.

A Security Beast Built Bit By Bit

We started because we were tired. Tired of combing through domain lists and forensic data manually, tired of searching through numerous sites for all the data we needed. We patiently waited for the perfect tool, but it never came. Our solution had to be vast, fast, and able to update daily — so we assembled a talented team and built it from scratch.
SecurityTrails was founded in June 2017, and from the very start it was decided that it would be a fully remote team. What began as a team of three people based in the US has grown into a team that currently counts 30 individuals. And that’s not even taking into account the number of contractors we work with, living and working across the entire globe.",https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=b91018515c5b1694&fccid=f9ac834f0764c7ef&vjs=3,United States,,,indeed.com,Security Trails,,,

Cyber Security Architect (AWS),2021-05-25T21:09:49.666338,"North, SC","Experience : Architect Level

Hello! Are you ready to Work from Home and transform your career?

We're looking for an experienced and enthusiastic Cyber Security Architect with a focus on AWS to join our consulting team. Want to help our client's build awesome solutions to accomplish their goals and vision? Are you interested in working from home with some of the best talent on the planet? Then keep reading.

About You

You have experience in analyzing existing systems from a security and best practices perspective and proposing recommendations for improvements. Your background will include experience with networking (Windows and Linux) and web hosting and how this translates to the cloud. Your focus will be on Amazon Web Service systems. You'll have experience with multi-account AWS infrastructure and good governance mechanisms. You have expert knowledge of IAM, hybrid on-premises and cloud systems, and how AWS native security solutions (GuardDuty, SecurityHub, Macie.) factor into the mix.

You'll be broadly familiar with concepts such as GDPR, CCPA, ISO-27001, PCI compliance and MITRE ATT&CK, but don't need to be an expert in all of them. You understand DevOps processes and how infrastructure as code can be used to build out cloud systems. Your security background may have included working as one or more of: a security analyst, managing endpoint solutions, Blue Team or Red Team, Cloud Incident Response or architecting secure multi-cloud systems in the past.

You know what a SIEM is. You're familiar with secret vaulting choices, PAM and monitoring options that can be leveraged in AWS. You'll understand concepts around DevSecOps pipelines including static analysis, secret scanning and container vulnerability scanning. You augment your knowledge of cloud systems by using tools such as ScoutSuite for asset and vulnerability detection.

You'll be familiar with agent/endpoint security and have been exposed to tools like Nessus/Tenable.io, CrowdStrike, BitDefender or similar. You'll also be familiar with cloud-native security options. As well as being AWS focused you'll be a generalist when it comes to information security. You attend conferences, and even better talk/volunteer/help organize them. You enjoy CTF challenges, reading or listening to podcasts on the subject. You are happy presenting to clients including senior management and have good written skills for compiling findings and recommendations reports.

Finally, you have a passion for learning. You won't mind expanding your skill set, and getting some exposure to Azure and GCP, especially to help understand how these factor into multi-cloud solutions with AWS and Active Directory in the mix.

Having overlap with your team is critical when working in a global remote team. Modus requires all team members to overlap with EST morning hours daily. In addition, reliable high speed internet is a must.

SRE / DevOps - Europe | Remote,2021-06-01T21:05:26,Remote,"Remote (Europe)
Who we are?
At Lenses.io we are on a mission to democratize streaming data, helping businesses to operate in real-time.
Our technology allows organizations to practice DataOps, a new way of consuming, processing and moving data. Our product makes working with cutting-edge open-source technologies more accessible to users and operationalizes them for enterprises. Our customers, who range from household names like Daimler-Benz and Adidas to cloud-native startups, use Lenses to help run their strategic streaming and software applications: think IoT, fraud-detection AI engines and cutting-edge consumer-facing microservices.
Looking to make a difference?
The Lenses.io SRE team is expanding, and you could be our next, new valuable member!
More often than not, SRE, DevOps, and Ops stand for way too many responsibilities to list on a single page. We are not going to lie, it’s the same for us, and our little shared secret is that we do enjoy our role —and hopefully, the same stands for you because we have a ton of work ahead of us.
There are three roles currently open:
SRE/Platform with solid abilities in SaaS and managed services (senior)
SRE/Platform, preferably with experience in Apache Kafka (mid/senior)
SRE/DevOps (mid/senior)
We also welcome junior applicants who are eager to evolve their careers.
If you are curious, open-minded, hungry, and eager to learn then Lenses.io is the place for you!
Let’s go over the role descriptions. Note that all our SREs take tasks from both tracks —that’s what we call them, platform and devops—, but the respective track is favored when it comes to architectural tasks or challenging problems.
What your day-to-day looks like:
SRE/Platform
You are focused on providing and supporting services for the company, our clients, and users. Obviously, it has to be fast, secure, scalable, and robust though we keep these descriptions for our presentations. In day-to-day life this means building blocks of infrastructure, implementing new functionality, automating, orchestrating, provisioning, keeping things up-to-date, and maintaining.
SRE/Platform with solid abilities in SaaS and managed services
We want to offer Lenses as a managed service. We have an awesome team building our portal and we are looking into the SRE who will lead the Lenses deployment architecture and implementation. The work has already started but you will play a key role in shaping the Lenses cloud. Our software connects to customers’ systems, has access to data and secrets. It will be your responsibility to make it secure. Words like SoC2 and ISO 270001 should not scare you.
SRE/DevOps
You will be supporting our product directly. Although devops is a culture, DevOps engineers are valuable members who accelerate developers by taking charge of the tough challenges for the delivery process like CICD, release automation and packaging. Mind you that these challenges are not only tough, but they are ongoing. As the product evolves, so does the delivery process.
Primary Technology Stack
The most common parts of our current stack include:
Docker
Kubernetes
Terraform
Jenkins
Google Cloud
Amazon AWS
Bash scripts
Go language
Linux servers
Apache Kafka
Helm
Of course, we touch way more technologies than just these. Our product is developed primarily using the technologies below, so part of your DevOps tasks will include interacting with them:
Scala (JVM), sbt
Javascript (React, Angular), yarn
What you will bring
Hopefully, we are going to spend many years working together. It’s important that we are compatible:
You love being an SRE and are eager to learn and become better
You have some experience in computer science (or similar) and distributed systems
You are not afraid to ask questions, give and receive feedback
You have experience in most of our primary technology stack
You have strong problem-solving skills, which for us means not only you can solve a problem but also you can explain how you did it and why your solution is correct
You are security, performance, and best-practice conscious
You are able to take responsibilities and own projects (implementation or even design-wise)
You like working in a team and you are able to push through language and cultural barriers to work with engineers all over the world
You want to automate everything
No task is beneath or above you. Documentation, support, and even little tasks are things we all do often. This applies even to our CEO!
Passionate about
Technology
Customer Success
Trying new tactics and messaging
Being part of a team
Sharing success with others
Inspiring people
Being Part of the Lenses.io team
You will join our International team with Lensiors spanning 8 countries and Offices in London, Athens, and New York. We have a distributed and remote-friendly culture to cover the full spectrum of working from a modern office to fully remote. (We are currently operating in full remote mode)
You will be defining, not following, the market
You will have a huge individual influence on the direction of the company
An opportunity to work with exceptional people at the forefront of their fields
Even More Benefits
An awesome, open, and vibrant start-up environment
Play a significant role in the development of the company and attain the opportunity for rapid career progression and personal growth
Flexible working hours
An opportunity to work with exceptional, professional people at the forefront of their fields
Be you!
Lenses.io is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace. We celebrate difference, support it, and thrive on a diverse team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, beliefs and experiences. The more inclusive we are, the better we are, and our work will be.
If you have a disability or special need that requires accommodation at any point through the interview process, please do not hesitate to let us know.
We’d love to hear from you!

Musculoskeletal (MSK) problems are the costliest medical category today, accounting for $432 billion cost alone in the US, four times the cost of diabetes and Heart disease. One key reason for this high cost has been the current “fee-for service” care model in the US where patients are treated in an uncoordinated manner throughout their care pathway. The mission of SpineZone is to reduce both the unnecessary suffering of these MSK patients and the total cost of care through an integrated holistic program that includes not only physical therapy but also education, diet and behavioral programs. The company was started by a group of spinal surgeons whose philosophy is to acknowledge the latent potentials of both mind and the body to heal and correct itself, and only intervening with costly injections and surgery when all other non-invasive interventions have not alleviated the suffering. The company has been operating several physical therapy clinics in California as well as an online, and has accumulated a trove of structured and unstructured data covering several years of patient features, interventions and outcomes. The company is also contributing to medical research through publications in leading journals and conferences in MSK.

Product team: to understand customer (therapists, insurance clients, PCPs, ..) needs and opportunities
ML team: to support complementary efforts and help refine the end-to-end MLOps architecture and technologies, from labeling platforms, high dimensional ETLs to model serving and distribution shift detection and retraining pipelines.
Requirements
We are looking for applied ML researchers in mid to senior stages of their career to join us in this exciting journey to reduce the unnecessary suffering of patients. The position can be remote or in San Diego, CA. In particular, we are looking for individuals who have the following characteristics:
Technical
